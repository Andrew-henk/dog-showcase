# dog-showcase

A sample project for an interview; likely to be expanded in follow-ups.

## Tech Choices

- **NX monorepo** ~ tech-agnostic foundation
- **Angular** ~ my framework of choice
- **Two services** ~ separation between API calls and favorites state

## Beyond Initial Scope

- localStorage persistence for favorites
- Re-shuffle button for the dog grid

## Running the Project

`npx nx run dog-viewer:serve`
